# Intro to Tableau

This repository contains slides and resources for a talk introducing Tableau, a data visualization tool. In this talk, I cover:

* An interface tour of Tableau
* Four hands-on exercises
* A history of data visualization, starting from 3500 BCE
* An overview of best practices for data visualization
* Deceptive and manipulative charts and graphs, and the three major tricks people use to try to deceive us with numbers

The slides and resources can always be found [here](http://lisawilliams.github.io/intro-to-tableau).

The files and datasets used in this talk are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xprL3p46tRB_yCJSEnJ55gRqfucuaZJO?usp=sharing)
