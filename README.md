# Intro to Visual Thinking for Data Visualization

This repository contains slides and resources for a talk on visual thinking
for people interested in data visualization. In this talk, I cover:

* A history of data visualization, starting from 3500 BCE
* An overview of best practices for data visualization
* Deceptive and manipulative charts and graphs, and the three major tricks people use to try to deceive us with numbers

The slides and resources can always be found [here](http://lisawilliams.github.io/visual-thinking).

If you are interested in more of my writing or tutorials, you can find
my blog here: [Lisa Williams, technologist](http://lisawilliams.github.io/lisa/).
